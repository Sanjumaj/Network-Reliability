# Network-Reliability
To find the reliability of the network

# Description
The project aims to investigate the relationship between network reliability and the reliabilities of individual components in a specific network topology. It focuses on analyzing how link failures affect network connectivity. Through systematic experiments varying 'p', the goal is to quantify the impact of link failures and identify critical thresholds for network disconnection.This project employs an exhaustive enumeration algorithm to comprehensively evaluate network reliability. It examines all possible scenarios of network failure, avoiding approximations, and providing a precise assessment of overall reliability. This exhaustive approach ensures a deep understanding of system resilience, aiding informed decisions to enhance network robustness.
